  "name": "Baby rebozo",
  "description": "During the Mexican revolution in the early 20th Century, rebel women used rebozos to carry babies, as well as for smuggling weapons past checkpoints. These days the rebozo can be found all over Mexico with varying styles and colors according to traditional local productions.\n\nThe art of weaving a rebozo is an oral tradition, taught by repetition, practice and observation and the time taken to complete a traditionally handwoven piece can vary from weeks to months depending on the design and the type of fiber being used, as well as the style of loom.
