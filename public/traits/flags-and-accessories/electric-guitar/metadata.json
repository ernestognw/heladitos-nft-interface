  "name": "Electric guitar",
  "description": "Although guitars have a long history, they had fallen behind the times in a way-especially in terms of volume-as many other instruments had been modified over the years. \nIt was around 1936 when a jazz guitarist named Charlie Christian (1916-1942) began using an acoustic guitar with a pickup attached to the body, with the intention of playing guitar solos in his band. This is said to be the birth of the electric guitar. (Yamaha)"
