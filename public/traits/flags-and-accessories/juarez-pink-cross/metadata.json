{"name":"Juarez pink cross","description":"Feminicide is the systematic gender-motivated murder of women. Thousands of missing women from this area are also believed to be victims of this femicide.  \n\nThe victims are typically poor women between the ages of 10 and 30 with reddish–brown skin, slender body types, and dark flowing hair. Many, but not all, of the women victims were employed in one the many maquiladoras in Cd. Juárez, factories on the U.S.–México border run by foreign companies. \n\nThe common social, economic, and physical characteristics of the victims suggest that the perpetrators specifically target women who fit this description.  Further, the ritual mutilation and symbolic placement of murdered bodies around the city indicates that drug cartels, among other organized crime groups, use the bodies to “mark their territory” in the bloody battle for money and control at the U.S.–México border.\n\nThe pink crosses are displayed as a visible resistance to the femicide."}
